# DrawTheWinner
With that simple Script, you can randomly draw one (or more) winners from a comma separated file. 

Long time I thought about how to manage small lotteries on different Discord Servers. Should I write my own Bot for that, or maybe is it enough to do it by hand? 
After long time I found out that this simple script can do the trick for me. 

# Technical details
* Simple easy to use script 
* No shady stuff going on there
  
# Known problems
* None atm. Feel free to open issues or improve the script.
